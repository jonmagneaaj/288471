                <p><span class="centered shadow-small">We’re refreshing support choices in the shop. They’ll be less poachable and have an expanded quest system that should be more satisfying overall. We’re also reducing the current complexity and rules bloat of the lineup.<br><br>Towards the goal of creating more satisfying items, supports will no longer have to upgrade these starter items in the shop. Instead, the quest system now automatically upgrades items to their second and third tiers when milestones are reached, with the Warding passive baked into those upgrades:<br><br>Tier 1 - Starting stats and gold generation passive<br>Tier 2 - Stats improved, 3 wards added<br>Tier 3 - Major stats upgrade, 4 ward capacity, gold generation passive removed<br><br>This unlocks supports to begin progressing toward their item builds without having to spend their first 1500g on completing their economy item. These starting support items won’t carry as many stats as before, but we think this is a fair tradeoff for the jump-start supports are getting on their other items.<br><br>The four starting support item options are:<br><br>High AD + Low HP + Spellthief’s passive<br>High AP + Low HP + Spellthief’s passive<br>Low AD + High HP + Targon’s passive<br>Low AP + High HP + Targon’s passive<br>(Coin removed)<br><br>When assessing the play patterns of the income passives, Targon’s and Coin both encourage a safer, more sustain-focused playstyle compared to Spellthief’s aggressive one. To simplify the support item system, we’re removing Coin and allowing ranged champions to use the execute element of Targon’s passive.<br><br>Finally, we’re adding a new poaching rule that significantly reduces the gold you get from minions if you’re farming them consistently. The tuning we want should still allow supports to secure a last-hit every now and then or even farm an occasional wave like today; the penalty only kicks in if item holders begin farming like non-supports. This new rule also allows us to remove the current anti-poaching mechanics on Spellthief’s (charge pausing on CS, nearby ally requirement for gold).</span></p>

                <p><span class="centered shadow-small">Lethality items are core for a pretty big group of AD assassins and fighters, but with only Duskblade and Ghostblade commonly used, choices feel limited. We want to make Edge of Night a more attractive option and add a fourth choice to the lineup:<br><br>Duskblade is mostly the same.<br>Ghostblade is also mostly the same.<br>-Edge of Night’s spellshield now works like Banshee’s Veil, which is a more straightforward effect that avoids the learning curve of an active item while also allowing for clearer counterplay opportunities for opponents.<br>Sanguine Blade is a new Lethality item that enables split pushing. Its unique passive grants a huge attack speed buff when no allies are nearby.<br><br>We’re also exploring a few other potential lethality item options that you may see on PBE.<br>Doubling the number of attractive Lethality items significantly increases assassins’ ability to tailor their early builds to their matchup or game state, but we don’t want to kill their later build variety by letting full-Lethality become optimal in every game. Individual items grant fewer stats but now feature a one- and two-piece bonus which preserves the power spikes of assassins’ first big purchases. Since this set bonus stops at two, assassins should generally branch into raw-AD items like Guardian Angel or Black Cleaver after their two-item spike. Full Lethality should still feel like a strong option against exceptionally squishy comps, though.</span></p>

Its unique passive when used by the most synergistic champions is lowering the downtime of some CC, mobility, and immunity spells beyond what we think leaves healthy room for counterplay.<br><br>We’re also looking for other small improvements we can make across the item system from now through the launch of preseason.</span></p>

                <p><span class="centered shadow-small">We’re tweaking some keystones to address a few problems they’ve created.<br><br>Conqueror has been too effective at allowing sustained damage fighters to deal with tanks, who have lost their place in solo lanes as a result. We’re toning down the anti-tank nature of the rune by removing the true damage conversion and putting more power into the stacking adaptive force.<br><br>Kleptomancy has been commonly used as a way to generate lots of gold in an uneven matchup, like ranged vs melee top lane. We’re pulling power out of the “farm gold off of my enemy” pattern and pushing more into the early game elixir drops.<br><br>Aftershock continues to attract squishy champs looking to negate their intended fragility. We’re lowering the flat resistances more on this rune and buffing the power it gives to tankier champions.</span></p>

Killed by a spoopy green ghost and trapped in his lantern for six years. And then… what? A suburban Demacian ranch with a white picket fence, a Pug’Maw to fetch the newspaper, and 2.5 kids? <br><br>No. That’s not good enough for League’s first support marksman. She wants more. An end to the Black Mist. Freedom from the curse that keeps the Mist hunting her. A chance to liberate all of the souls suffering within Thresh’s lantern. And a really cool weapon to do it all with.</span></p>
